# SocketIO and REST API server Demo

This repo contains a demo SocketIO and REST API server. This project is part of a larger demo to show data flow in an IIoT Application.

## SocketIO

Load localhost:3000 and it will give you a chat window. It will connect to the server and will provide data via logger and console.

## REST ends

Send a GET request to http://localhost:3000/api with a JSON body and it should return a dummy data from a dummy service as well as log the data to the console.
